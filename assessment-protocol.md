# Assessment Protocol

Systematic evaluation of game plans against Kojima Building Principles.

---

## Assessment Order

**Critical:** Always assess Dimension Zero first. Mythological substrate informs all other dimensions.

```
PHASE 1: Dimension Zero (Mythological Substrate)
PHASE 2: Surface Dimensions 1-9
PHASE 3: Cross-Dimensional Coherence
PHASE 4: Enhancement Prioritization
```

---

## Phase 1: Dimension Zero Assessment

### Evaluation Questions

| Question | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Is there an identifiable mythological substrate? | Y / N / Partial |
| If yes, which tradition(s)? | |
| Is mapping structural or superficial? | Structural / Superficial / Mixed |
| Do multiple elements connect through myth-logic? | Y / N |
| Is mythology hidden (felt, not stated)? | Y / N |
| Would removal change fundamental design? | Y / N |

### Scoring Rubric

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **5** | Deep structural mapping to coherent pantheon. Multiple traditions synthesized. Every major element has analog. Cross-references validate. Invisible but load-bearing. Supports academic analysis. |
| **4** | Clear primary framework. Most elements mapped. Some cross-reference coherence. Invisible and discoverable. |
| **3** | References present but not structural. Thematic rather than architectural. Could be removed without collapse. |
| **2** | Names/aesthetics borrowed. No structural relationship. "Mythological flavor" only. |
| **1** | No mythological dimension detected. |

### Priority Flag

```
IF dimension_zero_score < 3:
  SET priority = CRITICAL
  NOTE: "All other dimensions gain coherence when mythology established"
```

## Phase 2: Surface Dimension Assessment

- 3: Core identifiable but competing
- 1: No clear core loop

**Dimension 4 - Strand Systems:**
- 5: Rich asynchronous layer, mythologically framed
- 3: Basic asynchronous elements
- 1: No social dimension

**Dimension 5 - Consequence Architecture:**
- 5: Deep web with mythological resonance
- 3: Immediate + some delayed
- 1: Choices don't matter

**Dimension 6 - Character Ensemble:**
- 5: Full spectrum with archetypal depth
- 3: Some differentiation, unclear archetypes
- 1: Functional characters only

**Dimension 7 - Genre Alchemy:**
- 5: Unique fusion serving theme
- 3: Primary genre with secondary elements
- 1: Generic execution

**Dimension 8 - Contemplative Pacing:**
- 5: Masterful with ritual depth
- 3: Some quiet moments
- 1: Constant intensity

**Dimension 9 - SF/Horror Integration:**
- 5: Fully integrated with theme and myth
- 3: SF present, horror connected
- 1: Aesthetic only

## Phase 3: Cross-Dimensional Coherence

After individual scoring, evaluate integration:

### Coherence Questions

| Question | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Does mythology inform narrative layers? | Y/N |
| Do mechanics manifest both theme AND myth? | Y/N |
| Does arcade core support mythological expression? | Y/N |
| Do strand systems reflect mythological connection? | Y/N |
| Do consequences follow mythological justice? | Y/N |
| Do characters map to mythological archetypes? | Y/N |
| Does genre fusion reflect myth synthesis? | Y/N |
| Do contemplative moments function as ritual space? | Y/N |
| Does SF/horror embody technological sacred? | Y/N |

### Coherence Score

```
coherence_score = (yes_count / 9) * 5

IF coherence_score < 3:
  FLAG: "Dimensions operating independently—mythological unification needed"
```

---

## Phase 4: Enhancement Prioritization

### Priority Matrix

| Priority | Condition | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **0 (Critical)** | Dimension Zero < 3 | Establish mythological substrate first |
| **1 (High)** | Any dimension < 2 | Fundamental redesign needed |
| **2 (Medium)** | Any dimension 2-3 | Enhancement opportunity |
| **3 (Low)** | Dimension 3-4 | Refinement possible |
| **N/A** | Dimension 4-5 | No enhancement needed |

### Enhancement Effort Estimation

| Effort Level | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Reframing existing elements |
| **Medium** | New systems/content within existing structure |
| **High** | Fundamental redesign of core elements |

### Impact vs Effort Matrix

## Special Cases

### If Plan Has No Clear Mythology (Score 1)

```
RECOMMENDATION: Before other enhancements, establish mythological substrate.

SUGGESTED APPROACH:
1. Identify core theme of submitted plan
2. Research mythological traditions addressing that theme
3. Select 1-2 traditions for synthetic pantheon
4. Map existing elements to mythological analogs
5. Identify gaps requiring new elements
6. Integrate invisibly—structure not decoration
```

### If Plan Has Strong Mythology But Weak Mechanics

```
RECOMMENDATION: Mythology provides foundation; now manifest in systems.

SUGGESTED APPROACH:
1. For each core mechanic, identify mythological analog
2. Redesign mechanics to physically embody myth
3. Ensure arcade satisfaction preserved
4. Test: removing myth-mapping should change design
```

### If Plan Has Strong Arcade Core But No Depth

```
RECOMMENDATION: Arcade foundation is solid; layer meaning atop.

SUGGESTED APPROACH:
1. Preserve core loop exactly
2. Add thematic layer mechanics embody
3. Establish mythological substrate beneath theme
4. Ensure depth never compromises arcade satisfaction
```

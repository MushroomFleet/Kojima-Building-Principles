description: Game development planning enhancement using Kojima design philosophy. Triggered by phrase "using Kojima building principles". Analyzes submitted game plans against Dimension Zero (mythological substrate mapping to Iroquois creation myth, Egyptian cosmology, World Tree archetype) and nine surface dimensions (narrative layering, mechanical-thematic-mythological fusion, arcade foundation, strand systems, consequence architecture, character ensemble, genre alchemy, contemplative pacing, SF/horror integration). Outputs README_KJ.md with scored assessment and complete enhanced plan. Use when user submits any game design document, GDD, pitch, or concept and requests Kojima-style enhancement.

# Kojima Building Principles

Enhance game development plans by applying Hideo Kojima's design philosophy—where mythological substrate provides invisible structural DNA, mechanics physically manifest themes, and arcade-pure cores support infinite depth.

## Activation

Trigger: **"using Kojima building principles"** with a game plan/concept.

## Workflow

```
1. RECEIVE game plan
2. READ references/mythological-substrate.md
3. ASSESS Dimension Zero (mythology) - score 1-5
4. READ references/surface-dimensions.md  
5. ASSESS nine surface dimensions - score each 1-5
6. IDENTIFY enhancements for any dimension < 3
7. READ references/output-template.md
8. GENERATE README_KJ.md with analysis + enhanced plan
```

## Core Insight

Kojima maps designs to creation mythologies as invisible load-bearing structure:
- **Iroquois:** Twin Snakes (Solid/Liquid = Sapling/Flint), world-building from void
- **Egyptian:** The Beach as Duat, repatriation as Osiris cycle, Ka/Ba soul mechanics
- **World Tree:** Chiral Network, Patriots AI—invisible systems connecting all points

**The Test:** If removing mythological mapping changes nothing, it's decoration. True integration means scholars could write papers on it, but players never need to know.

## Dimension Overview

| # | Dimension | Key Question |
|---|-----------|--------------|
| 0 | Mythological Substrate | What creation myth structures this world? |
| 1 | Narrative Layering | Surface → Theme → Myth → Meta? |
| 2 | Mechanical Fusion | Does mechanic embody theme AND myth? |
| 3 | Arcade Foundation | What's the 30-second pure loop? |
| 4 | Strand Systems | How do strangers help strangers? |
| 5 | Consequence Architecture | Do choices echo through myth-logic? |
| 6 | Character Ensemble | Does cast cover thematic spectrum via archetypes? |
| 7 | Genre Alchemy | What incompatible genre creates friction? |
| 8 | Contemplative Pacing | Where is ritual space for reflection? |
| 9 | SF/Horror Integration | What's the technological sacred? |

## Quick Assessment

**Dimension Zero (assess first):**
- 5: Deep structural mapping, invisible but load-bearing
- 3: References present but not structural
- 1: No mythological dimension

**If Dimension Zero < 3:** Highest priority. All other dimensions gain coherence when mythology is established.

## Constraints

- **Invisible integration:** Mythology felt, never stated in-game
- **Structural necessity:** Removal must break design, not just remove flavor
- **Cultural respect:** These are living traditions; research deeply
- **Preserve vision:** Amplify creator intent, don't replace
- **Arcade untouched:** Depth never compromises accessibility

## The Ultimate Test

Design achieves Kojima integration when:
1. Scholar could connect it to source myths
2. Players never need to know mythology exists
3. Myths are systems, not just story
4. Arcade satisfaction fully intact
5. Feels "about something" even if inarticulable

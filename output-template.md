## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: What is this project? What are the key enhancement opportunities? What is the recommended mythological framework?]

---

## Part I: Assessment

### Dimension Zero: Mythological Substrate

#### Current State
[Describe any existing mythological elements, references, or structural patterns in the original plan. If none, state "No mythological substrate detected."]

#### Recommended Framework

**Primary Tradition:** [e.g., Iroquois Creation Myth]
**Secondary Tradition:** [e.g., Egyptian Cosmology]
**Rationale:** [Why these traditions fit the project's themes]

#### Structural Mapping

| Game Element | Mythological Analog | Tradition | Function |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|----------|
| [Protagonist] | [e.g., Sky Woman's descendant] | [Iroquois] | [Bridge between worlds] |
| [Core Mechanic] | [e.g., Animals diving for mud] | [Iroquois] | [World-building action] |
| [Antagonist] | [e.g., Flint/Tawiscaron] | [Iroquois] | [Necessary opposition] |
| [Setting] | [e.g., Turtle Island] | [Iroquois] | [World from void] |
| [Death System] | [e.g., Duat passage] | [Egyptian] | [Liminal transformation] |

#### Pantheon Synthesis
[If using multiple traditions, explain how they weave together. What does each tradition contribute? How do they create richer meaning together?]

#### Dimension Zero Score: [X]/5

| Mythology too visible | Medium | High | Never name sources; test with naive players |
| Cultural insensitivity | Low | Critical | Deep research; consultation if possible |
| Arcade core compromised | Medium | Critical | Test core loop in isolation after each change |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Prioritize ruthlessly; some enhancements optional |

## Appendix C: The Kojima Test

Final validation that enhanced plan meets criteria:

- [ ] Scholar could connect it to source myths
- [ ] Players never need to know mythology exists  
- [ ] Myths are systems, not just story
- [ ] Arcade satisfaction fully intact
- [ ] Feels "about something" even if inarticulable

---

*Enhanced using Kojima Building Principles*
*"Every mechanical system is an opportunity for thematic expression, and every player action is an opportunity for meaningful consequence."*
```

## Usage Notes

### Adapting the Template

- Not every section required for every project
- Remove sections that don't apply (e.g., no multiplayer = skip Strand Systems)
- Expand sections where project has particular depth or need
- The Enhanced Plan (Part V) is the primary deliverable; Parts I-IV are supporting analysis

### Tone Guidelines

- Professional but not dry
- Confident in recommendations but respectful of original vision
- Never condescending about original plan's gaps
- Frame enhancements as opportunities, not corrections

### Length Guidance

- Executive Summary: 3-5 sentences
- Assessment sections: Concise tables + brief notes
- Enhancement sections: As detailed as needed for implementation
- Enhanced Plan: Complete and standalone (may be longest section)
- Appendices: Reference material, not critical reading
